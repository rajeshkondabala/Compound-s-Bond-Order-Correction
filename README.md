# Compound-s-Bond-Order-Correction
Tool to correct the bond order issues in a compound structure.

A "bond order correction" generally refers to adjustments made to the idealized or formally calculated bond order to more accurately reflect the true nature of bonding in a compound.
In the context of molecular docking with AutoDock, a bond order correction refers to the process of reassigning or restoring the proper bond orders in a ligand’s chemical structure after the docking simulation has been performed. This step is necessary because AutoDock’s input format (typically the PDBQT format) does not explicitly encode bond order information. Instead, it infers bond orders based on atom types, distances, and angles. For simple molecules or those containing mostly single bonds, this heuristic works reasonably well, but it can introduce errors in more complex systems—such as aromatic rings, conjugated systems, and structures with hypervalent atoms.
After docking, these inaccuracies can lead to significant issues. For instance, if the bond orders are misassigned, the resulting molecular structure might not represent the true chemical species. This misrepresentation can affect downstream analyses, including:

 1. Valence Accuracy: Incorrect bond orders can lead to impossible valence configurations, rendering some docked poses chemically implausible.
 2. Geometric Integrity: Bond orders are closely linked to bond lengths and angles. Inaccurate orders can distort the intended geometry, affecting interpretations of binding interactions.
 3. Reactivity and Scoring: Many scoring functions rely on an accurate depiction of the electronic structure. Any errors in bond orders can lead to misleading estimations of binding free energies or other key energetic properties.

To address these challenges, chemists often use post-docking processing tools such as RDKit's AssignBondOrdersFromTemplate function. Here, the original (correct) ligand structure used as a template with proper bond order information is employed to reassign the bond orders to the docked pose. This correction is crucial for ensuring that the chemical integrity of the ligand is maintained, leading to more reliable predictions of how the molecule interacts within the binding site.
This post-docking step is essential not just to "clean up" the results but also to build a systematic and reproducible docking pipeline. Correct bond order assignments facilitate accurate downstream applications, whether for energy minimizations, molecular dynamics simulations, or further chemical reactivity studies. Moreover, by ensuring that the molecule adheres to proper chemical rules, researchers can more confidently correlate computational findings with experimental data, ultimately aiding in the design and optimization of potential drug candidates.
